===================
 Nanode-RESTbitlash
===================

Overview
========
To provide a REST interface for the bitlash environment.
http://wiki.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Project:Nanode/Bitlash

Features
========
*Webserver running on the nanode
*Bitlash library to initialise and run bitlash.
*Filter for URL that has http://<ip>/RESTbitlash/<command>
*Grab everything after /RESTbitlash/
*Use doCharacter(char c) to pipe each char to the bitlash console, one at a time

Installation
============
1. Download and extract http://bitlash.net/wiki/_media/bitlash-2.0-rc3d.zip from http://bitlash.net/wiki/start
2. Rename bitlash-2.0-rc3d to bitlash and place in your arduino environment's /libraries folder. More detailed information regarding the installation of bitlash can be found here: http://bitlash.net/wiki/install
3. Please note that to install Bitlash 2.0 RC3d on a nanode you need to do the following:
4. Edit libraries/bitlash/src/bitlash-instream.c by commenting out "#define SDFILE" at or near line 32: //#define SDFILE
6. Now restart the Arduino IDE, open examples->bitlash->bitlashdemo and upload to your Arduino

Requirements

Further Work / Other Ideas
==========================
samthetechie's idea / take on the system:
*Generating GET and POST from what is typed into a text box / terminal window.
*A pretty Nanode OS boot sequence.
*An interactive terminal written in javascript for the Nanode
